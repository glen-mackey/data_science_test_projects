# data_science_test_projects
A repo to store some projects to test out different data science methodologies.

This repo will grow as I try out new ML, visualization, dashboarding, etc. techniques.

requirements.txt is a list of Python Libraries that need to be loaded to run the notebooks in Binder.

runtime.txt specifies the Python version to use.  functools @cached_property requires Python>=3.8.

binder_links.txt contains links to visit web-hosted versions of the notebooks in Binder.  Copy and paste to access a live version of the notebook.
