    "# KMeans Clustering Forward - Inverse Project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "KMeans Clustering is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning technique for understanding which data points may be related based on similarity between feature variable values.  Because supervised learning techniques make use of labeled data, the accuracy of the fit can be assessing by splitting the data into training and testing set, fitting the model with the training set, and measuring the accuracy of the predictions on the testing set.  However, assessing the quality of the fit for an unsupervised model with an un-labeled data set is not so straight forward.  Presumably, the KMeans algorithm should do a better job of properly identifying clusters when the inter-cluster distances significantly exceeds intra-cluster data point distances, but accuracy should degrade as the clusters are moved closer together and the data points begin to overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to assess the fit of the KMeans clustering algorithm in `Scikit-Learn` by forward modeling a data set of several clusters with noise, applying the KMeans clustering algorithm to divide the generated data set into clusters, and then visualizing the sets of clusters to compare the forward and inverse models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of the number of clusters to use (K in KMeans) is accomplished by fitting the data with a series of K values and selecting the 'best' fit using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).  A more common strategy for selecting the 'best' fit is to plot the residual sum of squares versus the number of clusters and select the point of maximum curvature, i.e., the 'elbow' in the curve.  In my experience trying to apply this approach to picking regularization hyper-parameters in regression/inversion modeling, it is easy to pick the elbow visually, but automating the algorithm to pick the point of maximum curvature regularly fails because of noise in the plot that the eye can smooth over; this noise can come from many sources, e.g., an incomplete fit due to hitting an `it_max` in the clustering algorithm.  Since the goal of the project is to implement fully automated picking I felt that AIC was a more robust solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment of the accuracy of the fit is done visually, although in the future it could be quantified using a Fisher's Exact test of a $\\chi^2$-test.  The output are a pair of plots of the forward modeled data points, color coded by the true label, alongside the inverse modeled data points, color coded by the label assigned by the clustering algorithm; labels for the forward and inverse data are reconciled to avoid any label mismatch due to the order of the inverted cluster centroids provided by the KMeans algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall algorithm is made interactive so the user can select forward model input values, run the full algorithm, and see the updated output simply by adjusting the values with slider widgets and hitting the 'Run' button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is structured in four section: the forward model, the inverse model, data visualization, and interactive implementation.  Each section contians a series of relevant functions, culminating in a single function that implements that section of the algorithm.  For example, the inverse modeling section has functions to fit the forward modeled data with an inverse model of K clusters, to repeat this fit procedure for different K values, to 'score' each fit, to select the ideal K value based on the returned scores, and to reconcile labels to facilitate plotting, all called by a 'master' function for that section that returns the relevant output.  The 'master' functions for each of the first three sections are called in the `main_function()`, which itself is called by the `interact_manual()` function, in the interactive section of the program.  Thus, changing variable values using the interactive widgets generates new forward and inverse model data, which are visualized using the data visualization section.\n",

    "This section implements the inverrse model by taking the data points generated in the forward model section and fitting the data points with K clusters.  The data fit with different values of K, each fit is 'scored' by AIC, and the 'best' fit is returned.  Even if the inverse centroids perfectly line up with the forward modeled cluster centers, they may not be sorted in the same order by the KMeans algorithm, thus the labels for each data point could be wrong even if they have been perfectly clustered.  Labels are reconciled by matching the inverse centroids to their nearest foward modeled cluster centers.  This section returns the ideal K value, the corresponding `KMeans()` object, and an array of the tested AIC values for visualization."

    "This section implements all of the previous sections in `main_function()`, and ties `main_function()` to an `interact_manual()` widget.  By adjusting the input variable values with the widgets, a new forward model is generated, fit with an inverse model, and the results are visualized.  The inverse modeling and visualization sections require too much procesing time to live update results as you drag each widget slider bar, so a manual `Run_Interact` button is used to reduce lag.  Once values for the variables are set, clicking `Run_Interact` will run the algorithm and generate the plots.\n",
